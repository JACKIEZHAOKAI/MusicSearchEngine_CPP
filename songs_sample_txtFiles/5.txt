Well, you know those times when you feel like there's a sign there on your back
Says I don't mind if ya kick me seems like everybody has
Things go from bad to worse, you'd think they can't get worse than that
And then they do

You step off the straight and narrow and you don't know where you are
Use the needle of your compass to sew up your broken heart
Ask directions from a genie in a bottle of Jim Beam
And she lies to you
That's when you learn the truth

If you're going through hell
Keep on going, don't slow down
If you're scared, don't show it
You might get out before the devil even knows you're there

Well, I been deep down in that darkness I been down to my last match
Felt a hundred different demons breathing fire down my back
And I knew that if I stumbled I'd fall right into the trap 
That they were laying, yeah

But the good news is there's angels everywhere out on the street
Holding out a hand to pull you back upon your feet
The one's that you been dragging for so long you're on your knees
You might as well be praying
Guess what I'm saying

If you're going through hell
Keep on going, don't slow down
If you're scared, don't show it
You might get out before the devil even knows you're there

Yeah, if you're going through hell
Keep on moving, face that fire
Walk right through it
You might get out before the devil even knows you're there

If you're going through hell
Keep on going, don't slow down
If you're scared, don't show it
You might get out before the devil even knows you're there

Yeah, if you're going through hell
Keep on moving, face that fire
Walk right through it
You might get out before the devil even knows you're there
Yeah, you might get out before the devil even knows you're there, yeah
